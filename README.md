# Medical-Cabinet

This is a project made for my second year's C# and .Net Course in ENIT(Tunisia) as an IT engineer.
The project is about designing interfaces for different uses for different roles for different users.

Each user would have a role and some interfaces to see or not. Interfaces are usually about basic CRUD operations on
basic Database entities.

# Note :
